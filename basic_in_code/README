A test to instrument functions using only the xray annotations specified in source.

Mode: Basic (fdr cannot be enabled without source code additions)

The annotations specify the requirements specified in xray_attr_file in basic_attr_file
test.

The argument is logged as base 10 value of the argument. The pointer address if it is pointer.

The xray annotations are working as expected except for 'clang::xray_log_args(2)'. The
second argument is not being logged.

Caveats:

1) Second argument to function not being logged
