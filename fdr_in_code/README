A test to instrument functions using only the xray annotations specified in source.

Mode: FDR

The annotations specify the requirements specified in xray_attr_file in basic_attr_file
test.

The argument is logged as base 10 value of the argument. The pointer address if it is pointer.

The xray annotations are working as expected except for 'clang::xray_log_args(2)'. The
second argument is not being logged.

No difference between log generated by this and the equivalent basic mode.

The only difference is that FDR must be enabled using in source and the finalize buffer, flush log functions
must be called at the end of the program to create the log file.

Caveats:

1) Second argument to function not being logged
