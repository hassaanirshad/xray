A test to instrument functions using only the xray annotations specified in source AND specify argument handler.

Mode: Basic (fdr cannot be enabled without source code additions)

The annotations specify the requirements specified in xray_attr_file in basic_attr_file
test.

A handler is added using the api specified here: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/compiler-rt/include/xray/xray_interface.h

Caveats:

Arguments are no longer logged by xray and the argument handler function is called instead.
The argument handler is not being called for the second argument.
All arguments are passed as uint64_t. So, if it is a pointer then the handler has to cast it itself and use it. (not safe)
Cannot have multiple handlers at the same time but can switch handlers between function calls.
