A test to instrument functions using only the xray annotations specified in source AND specify argument handler.

Mode: FDR

The annotations specify the requirements specified in xray_attr_file in basic_attr_file
test.

A handler is added using the api specified here: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/compiler-rt/include/xray/xray_interface.h

Caveats:

Arguments are no longer logged by xray and the argument handler function is called instead.
The argument handler is not being called for the second argument.
All arguments are passed as uint64_t. So, if it is a pointer then the handler has to cast it itself and use it. (not safe)
Cannot have multiple handlers at the same time but can switch handlers between function calls.
No difference between log generated by this and the equivalent basic mode.

The only difference is that FDR must be enabled using in source and the finalize buffer, flush log functions
must be called at the end of the program to create the log file.
